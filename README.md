I generated a map of six of my favorite locations. 
There’s UCSB, the college I attend.
The Goleta Pier, a beautiful and relaxing spot that reminds me of a pier in my hometown in China. 
Mount Baldy is an awesome mountain I often went with my family and friends during vacation. 
Universal Studios Hollywood is my favorite theme park. 
STAPLES Center brought me so many incredible memories of watching my favorite basketball team. 
Griffith Park is just an ordinary city park, but it’s one of my favorite locations just because I spent so much time there relaxing and hanging out.
